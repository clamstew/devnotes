# Dev Notes

===========

An attempt to make an interface that can handle typical build notes that I make in evernote.

This will test if markdown and drag and drop interfaces can be a better or equivalent tool than a free form text document in an editor like evernote. It may be hard to match the freedom of that type of workflow for capturing notes.
